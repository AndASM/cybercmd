## cybercmd
Command-line argument loader for Cyberpunk 2077.

### usage
- if you use CET:
    - extract [the latest ZIP release](https://github.com/jac3km4/cybercmd/releases) in the game directory
- if you don't use CET:
    - you'll additionally need to download the [ASI loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/version.zip), and extract `version.dll` into `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\`

### usage from mods
When the game starts, it'll look for arguments to load in TOML files placed inside `Cyberpunk 2077\engine\config\cybercmd\`.
You can see a reference file [here](https://github.com/jac3km4/cybercmd/blob/master/reference/cmd.toml).
