## cybercmd
Command-line argument loader for Cyberpunk 2077.

### usage
- if you use CET:
    - download and extract [cybercmd.zip from the latest release release](https://github.com/jac3km4/cybercmd/releases) into the main game directory
- if you don't use CET:
    - download and extract [cybercmd-standalone.zip from the latest release release](https://github.com/jac3km4/cybercmd/releases) into the main game directory
        - if prompted, do not overwrite any files except for `cybercmd.asi`

### usage from mods
When the game starts, it'll look for arguments to load in TOML files placed inside `Cyberpunk 2077\engine\config\cybercmd\`.
You can see a reference file [here](https://github.com/jac3km4/cybercmd/blob/master/reference/cmd.toml).
